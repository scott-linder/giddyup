# GIDDYUP!

Does deploying your application seem like a bit too much of a chore?  Do you
wish it wasn't so hard?  Well, with giddyup it can become just a tiny bit
easier.

If you've ever used, or seen, Heroku's git-based deployment model, you know
how simple app deployment *can* be.  While we don't try to emulate all of
Heroku's excellent infrastructure, giddyup does handle a small corner of
that -- the ability to deploy your app with a simple 'git push'.


# Installation

At this stage, giddyup is only available directly as a git repo.  There are
no versioned releases, nor are there distribution packages available.  My
recommendation is to create a clone of the [main giddyup
repo](https://github.com/mpalmer/giddyup) somewhere (I suggest
`/usr/local/lib/giddyup` if you've got root, and probably `~/giddyup`
otherwise) and then to update to newer giddyup functionality, just `git
pull` in that clone.  You then have a fixed location to point your hook
symlinks and inclusions of `functions.sh`.

Eventually, when giddyup stabilises there will be distribution packages;
they'll likely put everything into `/usr/lib/giddyup`, at which time you can
just delete your git repo at `/usr/local/lib/giddyup` and symlink that
location `/usr/lib/giddyup`, and nothing else will need to change.

Symlink the `giddyup` script to somewhere in your `PATH`; this will allow
you to trivially setup new deployment destinations.  Do **not** *copy* the
`giddyup` script; it relies on being in the same directory as `update-hook`
in order to be able to find the hook script.


# Setting up new deployments

1. Run the `giddyup` script, passing it the location of the "root" of your
   new deployment.  The script will create the basic directory structure and
   symlink the update hook into the right place.

2. Set the git config variables in the config for the repo you
   created in step 1 (see the section "Configuration" for the
   available variables)

    > e.g. `git config -f /home/appuser/appname/repo/config giddyup.environment
    > production`

3. Add the necessary hooks to your application's local git repo to effect
   proper deployment.

4. Add the newly created git repo as a remote in your local working copy,
   then push to that remote to make your initial deploy:

    > e.g. `git remote add deploy appuser@example.com:appname/repo;
    > git push deploy master:master`

5. Configure your webserver to pass requests to the appserver, and test that
   everything is working properly.


# Deployment tree structure

Giddyup creates a tree of directories underneath the specified "root"
directory, that contains (hopefully) everything related to your application. 
The structure is as follows:

* `repo`: This is the repository to which git pushes are made, and within
  which the Giddyup hook script is placed.  It must be a "bare" git repo
  (because otherwise Git gets ridiculously confused and annoyed) and it is
  the parent of this directory which is considered to be the "root" of the
  entire application.  (Note: this doesn't *actually* have to be named
  `repo`; but it's best to keep a consistent convention, for the sake of
  sanity).

* `shared`: All of your application's data which should persist between
  releases should be kept in here -- log files (if you want to keep the same
  log files between releases), **definitely** your customers' uploaded assets
  -- all that sort of thing goes in here, and should be symlinked from your
  release.  See the section "Shared data", below.

* `releases`: This is where each individual release goes.  Each deployment
  of your application gets a directory of it's own in here, named after the
  current date/time at the time of deployment, in the format
  `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.

* `current`: A symlink to the currently running version of your application.


## Shared data

Anything you need to be shared across deployments should live under the
`shared` directory, and symlinks placed in your releases to point to the
relevant data in `shared`.  You share things in your deployments by calling
the `share` helper function within your hook scripts.  This function will
take a relative path (relative to the root of your repo) and create a
symlink into the same path within `shared`.

For example, you might have a hook script that uses Bundler to setup your
local gems.  Since you don't want to have to dick around reinstalling all
your gems with every release, you want to share that bundle between
releases.  Your hook script might look something like this:

    . /path/to/giddyup/functions.sh
    share vendor/bundle
    cd "${RELEASE}"
    bundle install --deployment

This will create a symlink from `$ROOT/releases/<timestamp>/vendor/bundle`
to `$ROOT/shared/vendor/bundle`, then run bundle in the new release to
ensure that all your required gems are available.

If a file or directory already exists in `releases/<timestamp>` that is
supposed to be symlinked, we'll remove it before creating the symlink.  The
directory structure in `shared` will always mirror that of your releases
when you use `share`; this improves simplicity and comprehensibility.

If a symlink destination doesn't exist already within `shared`, then we'll
copy the source content in your release (if it exists) into `shared`. 
Leading directory components will be created in `shared` automatically, as
well.


# Hooks

Because everyone's application is slightly different, Giddyup itself doesn't
actually do very much itself -- instead, it delegates a lot of things back
to code that you write, as hooks.  To understand hooks, it's best to
understand how Giddyup works:

1. You push your updated code to the repo controlled by giddyup
2. The `update` hook, provided by Giddyup, starts to run
3. Giddyup makes a copy of the code in your deployment repo
4. Giddyup runs the `stop` hook
5. Giddyup changes the "current" symlink for the deployment to point at the
newly configured code
6. Giddyup runs the `start` hook
7. Old releases are tidied up, if required (see the `giddyup.keepreleases`
config variable)

To put it another way, the following hooks are available:

* **stop**: Run after the new release is in place, but while the system's
  idea of the "current" release still points to the currently running code. 
  You'll probably want to do whatever's required to stop your appserver from
  running in this hook, run bundler, and perhaps put up a maintenance page.

* **start**: Run after the "current" symlink has been changed to point to
  the new code.  In here you'd probably want to do database migrations,
  start your appserver, and take down your maintenance page.


## Running hooks

Giddyup always runs hooks from the **newly deployed** version of your
codebase (so that if you happened to push a deploy with a dodgy `stop` hook,
you can recover from it by pushing a fixed version).  It looks for hooks in
the location specified by the `giddyup.hookdir` git config variable (see
"Configuration", below).

It is looking for files or directories that match the name of the hook
(`start`, `stop`, etc).  If there is a file named after the hook, and it is
executable, then that file is executed.  If, on the other hand, there is a
directory named after the hook, then all executable files in that directory
are executed, in the lexical order of the names of the files.

If you really, *really* need to be able to run hook files that aren't
already executable (I don't know why; git stores executable bits just fine)
then you can set the `autochmodhooks` config variable; this will have the
effect of making *every* file in your hook directories (if you're using
them) a hook script.  So don't combine this config option with a `README`...

Each hook script is run as a separate process, and as such cannot effect the
environment or working directory of giddyup itself or any other hook script.


## Hook environment

The environment of the hook is very minimal; only the following environment
variables will be set:

* `PATH` -- the same as the path of the Giddyup script itself.
* `APP_ENV` -- the environment specified by `giddyup.environment` (see
"Configuration", below).
* `ROOT` -- the directory that is the "root" of the entire deployment; the
directory which the deployment git repository (and everything else) lives
* `RELEASE` -- the canonical directory that contains the data in this
release of the application.
* `NEWREV` -- The SHA of the commit being deployed.
* `OLDREV` -- The SHA of the commit being replaced.
* `FUNCS` -- the path to `functions.sh` used by current installation

The working directory of all hooks is the root of the deployment tree. 
During the 'stop' hook, the `current` symlink will point to the previous
running release of the application, while during the `start` hook the
`current` symlink will point to the new release you're currently deploying.


## Hook script helpers

To help you make your hook scripts easier to write, there are some shell
functions available to help you on your way.  To use them, merely add:

    . /path/to/giddyup/functions.sh

or

    . $FUNCS

at the top of your hook script, and then call away to your heart's content.



# Error handling

At present, the error handling in giddyup is a bit primitive.  In general,
if any part of the giddyup script fails, the whole process will abort.  This
*mostly* won't hurt your running app, because giddyup does as much as it can
before starting or stopping anything.  However, if your hook scripts bomb
out, or one of the things that runs between stopping and starting the app
fails, then things could be left in a bit of a limbo state.

Improvements to this part of the system, particularly around intelligent
rollback strategies, is planned.  Patches welcome.


# Configuration

Gidduyp is controlled by git repository configuration variables; these can
either be set using `git config` in the deployment repository, or by
directly editing the `config` file in the deployment repository.

Available configuration variables are given below.


## `giddyup.environment`

(**OPTIONAL**; default: none)

Many web application frameworks have a concept of "environments"; that is,
different sets of configuration parameters (like database credentials) that
vary between instances of the application running with the same source code.

Giddyup supports this paradigm with the use of the `giddyup.environment`
variable.  If set, the value will be passed through to the `APP_ENV`
environment variable in your hook scripts; this allows you to do slightly
different things (like reload a different appserver, or assist in running
your database migrations against a different database).  Since this
environment is specified per-repository, you can run several environments
(say, uat, staging, and production) with the same in-repo deployment hooks,
just by pushing to different remote repositories (which have different
settings for `giddyup.environment`, of course).


## `giddyup.hookdir`

(**OPTIONAL**; default `config/hooks`)

The directory within which Giddyup will look to find hook scripts, relative
to the root of your working copy.  The intent is that the hooks relating to
the deployment of your application are best kept *with* your application.


## `giddyup.keepreleases`

(**OPTIONAL**; default: 5)

Giddyup will keep a few older deployed releases available, in case you need
to make an emergency rollback, or examine exactly what was recently
deployed.  This configuration parameter determines how many releases to
keep.  Set this to 1 to not keep any previous releases, and set it to 0 if
you want to keep every release ever (not a good idea unless you've got one
of those fancy new infinite-capacity hard drives).


## `giddyup.debug`

(**OPTIONAL**; default: false)

If you want to have far, far too much gory detail about what giddyup is
doing, you can set this to true.


## `giddyup.autochmodhooks`

(**OPTIONAL**; default: false)

Sometimes the hook files found in `giddyup.hookdir` (e.g. in
`config/hooks/`) are not marked as executable in the repository.  Setting
`giddyup.autochmodhooks` to `true` will cause giddyup to set the executable
bit itself before running the hook script.


# Frequently Answered Questions

## What?  Is that all?

Yes, the main giddyup update hook script is quite minimal.  The aim here is
to provide the necessary scaffolding upon which customised deployment
processes can be implemented.

To put it another way: yes, Giddyup is small and dumb.  You're supposed to
provide the smarts in hooks.  If you have a general-purpose hook you'd like
to share with others, please feel free to [send it to
me](mailto:theshed+giddyup@hezmatt.org) and I'll include it in the examples.


## I need moah hooks!

Weeeeell... maybe you do, maybe you don't.  Remember that you can execute as
many different hook scripts as you like, and in the order you specify.  For
example, you might think you need a "pre-stop" hook, to do things that might
take a while, before the application is stopped (to minimise downtime).  You
don't actually need a separate hook in giddyup; all you need to do is move
the hook script that actually stops your appservers to after the hook script
that does whatever time-consuming task you have in mind.


## What's with the name?!?

Take the phrase "git deployment", chop off most of "deployment" to produce
something like "gitde", say it as a single word a few times until the 't'
kinda disappears and the 'e' lengthens so it sounds like "gidee", then shout
"yeehaw!" like an old time cowboy.  Waving of Stetsons is optional, but
strongly encouraged.
