# This is a file full of helper functions that are of use in hook scripts,
# as well as being common to different scripts in the giddyup deployment
# ecosystem.
#
# These functions rely on the correct, pre-existing global definition of the
# environment variables defined in the "Hook environment" section of
# README.md.  If you attempt to use these functions without those variables
# being set, Bad Things will likely happen.

# Create a symlink from within the `$RELEASE` into somewhere within
# `$ROOT/shared`.  The relative path within both `$RELEASE` and
# `$ROOT/shared` is given by the first (and only) argument to this function.
#
# Example:
#
#    share some/location
#
# This will create a symlink from $RELEASE/some/location to
# $ROOT/shared/some/location.
#
# NOTE: This function behaves differently depending on whether the symlink
# source (`$RELEASE/some/location`) already exists or not, and whether or
# not the destination exists.  The logic is as follows:
#
# * If the parent directory of the source location (in our example,
#   `$RELEASE/some`) or the destination location (in our example,
#   `$ROOT/shared/some`) does not already exist, it will be created.
#
# * If the source does not exist, then a symlink is created unconditionally.
#   If `$ROOT/shared/some/location` doesn't already exist, the symlink will
#   dangle until something (eg.  the start hook, or the application itself)
#   creates it.
#
# * If the source *does* exist, but the destination does not, then the
#   source will be moved to the destination before the symlink is created. 
#   This allows you to ship a default dataset in your application bundle,
#   safe in the knowledge that future updates won't overwrite it once it's
#   in the `shared` tree.

# execute all the files in that directory.  If a single file is found,
